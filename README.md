# Project: Circadian Rhythm Analysis Dashboard using Microsoft Power BI Desktop
# Project Description:
This project involves creating a comprehensive business intelligence dashboard using Microsoft Power BI Desktop to analyze circadian rhythms in male and female patients. The dashboard offers insights into sleep patterns, physical activity, medication usage, health issues, and hormonal levels for female patients. It provides visualizations in the form of cards, bar graphs, pie charts, and donut charts for effective data interpretation.

# Roadmap:
Data Collection: Gather patient data, including sleep hours, physical activity, medications, health conditions, family history, and hormone levels for female patients.
Data Processing: Clean and format the data for visualization in Power BI.

# Dashboard Creation:
Male Patients: Visualize sleep patterns, medication intake, health issues, and physical activity.
Female Patients: Visualize sleep patterns, hormone levels, period tracking, medication intake, and physical activity.
Deployment: Upload the final Power BI report to GitHub for access and demonstration.
Libraries/Tools Used:
Microsoft Power BI Desktop: For creating visualizations and dashboards.
Data Sources: CSV files, databases, or direct queries for patient data.

# Methodology:
Data Ingestion: Import relevant data into Power BI Desktop.
Data Transformation: Use Power Query for data cleaning, filtering, and preparing fields for visualizations.
Visualization:
Cards for total male and female patient counts.
Bar Charts for comparing estimated vs actual sleep hours and displaying health issues.
Pie Charts for medication taken by patients.
Donut Charts for family medical history and medications.
Line Graphs/Bar Charts for tracking melatonin, progesterone, and estrogen levels (female patients).
Insights Generation: Derive insights from the visualizations for circadian rhythm patterns in patients.
# Dashboard Features:
**1. Male Patients:**
Card: Displays the total count of male patients.
Importance: Provides a quick summary of the patient demographic, helping to segment and analyze data by gender.

Bar Graph: Comparison of estimated hours of relaxed sleep vs actual sleep per day.
Importance: Tracks discrepancies between expected and actual sleep, which is crucial for understanding sleep-related disorders and their impact on health.

Pie Chart: Distribution of medications taken by male patients.
Importance: Visualizes the proportion of different medications used, providing insight into common treatments and potential over-medication trends.

Bar Graph: Frequency of health issues such as anxiety and depression.
Importance: Highlights the prevalence of mental health issues, allowing healthcare providers to focus on high-risk areas for intervention.

Donut Chart: Family history of diseases or medication.
Importance: Shows familial patterns of diseases or medications, which can help in assessing genetic predispositions and personalized treatment plans.

Bar Graph: Estimated hours of physical activity per male patient.
Importance: Monitors physical activity levels, essential for understanding lifestyle impacts on health and promoting better physical well-being.

**2. Female Patients:**
Card: Displays the total count of female patients.
Importance: A quick reference for the female demographic, useful for gender-specific health analysis.

Bar Graph: Comparison of estimated hours of relaxed sleep vs actual sleep per day.
Importance: Helps identify sleep patterns and potential disorders affecting women's health, especially considering their unique biological cycles.

Pie Chart: Distribution of medications taken by female patients.
Importance: Provides insight into common medications among female patients, which is key for understanding treatment trends and pharmaceutical use.

Bar Graph: Frequency of health issues such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia.
Importance: Identifies key mental health challenges among female patients, particularly related to sleep and hormonal fluctuations, helping to target mental health initiatives.

Donut Chart: Family history of diseases or medication.
Importance: Helps trace familial health risks and medications, important for creating preventive strategies and understanding hereditary health patterns.

Bar Graph: Estimated hours of physical activity per female patient.
Importance: Monitors physical activity, crucial for addressing health risks associated with inactivity, such as obesity or cardiovascular disease.

Bar Graph: Melatonin, progesterone, and estrogen levels.
Importance: Tracks hormonal changes which can affect circadian rhythms, mood, and overall health, providing a more detailed analysis for female patients.

Period Tracking: Visualization of menstrual cycle patterns.
Importance: Important for understanding hormonal effects on circadian rhythms, sleep, and health in women, helping healthcare providers tailor advice and treatments.
